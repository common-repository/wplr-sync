Organize your photos in folders and collections. Synchronize with Lightroom. Make your life easier! :)

== Description ==

**Media Organizer**. You can now organize your photos in folders and collections. From those collections, you will be able to create galleries easily, without the need of a specific plugin.

**Synchronize with Lightroom**. Upload and keep your photos, collections, keywords and metadata synchronized with WordPress. Then, for instance, modifying your photos, their quality, or changing your watermark on all of them at once will be easy!

Learn more about it all here: [Photo Engine](https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/).

=== Media Organizer ===

You can use attributes (collections='...', keywords='...') in the standard WP Gallery shortcode to link your galleries to your collections and keywords. No need to own a specific plugin or anything, it works naturally with WordPress. The [Meow Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/) and the [Meow Lightbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-lightbox/) are recommended to enhance your galleries with better layouts and options. They can directly get your collections.

=== Synchronize with Lightroom ===

If your plan is to synchronize Lightroom with WordPress, you will also need the WP/LR Sync Plugin for Lightroom. Please have a look at the official website of [Photo Engine](https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/) for more information.

Do you have many photos in your WordPress already and they are not linked with your Lightroom? No problem, Photo Engine can do that too. Using EXIF and image perceptual analysis, the plugin will help you linking them through a process call Total Synchronization or you can do it manually. The process is explained here: [Total Synchronization](https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/tutorial/).

You are using a certain photo everywhere but you now have a better one? From Lightroom, you can swap one photo to another and this will be replicated automatically on your WordPress. You have nothing else to do. The module is called "Switch Photos" in Lightroom.

=== Support for Themes and Plugins ===

If you are using specific gallery plugins or photography themes, Photo Engine can bring all the power of Lightroom to them, magically, seamlessly. You will be free to choose the theme or gallery plugin you like the best and even switch between them. Photo Engine has a built-in extensions system so that you can extend it easily and support specific themes and plugins. A powerful extension called "Post Types" is already included and probably does everything you need. More information about it here: [Post Types Extension](https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/tutorial/).

=== API & External Apps ===

There is an external API available through Photo Engine that iPhone, Android developers or anybody else can use to make apps. There is one available for iPhone, you can search for it on the iTunes Store (it is not free, and not made by Meow Apps).

=== Unique & Powerful Plugin ===

I am myself an user of this plugin and even though it is the only one, I want to make it better every day. If you have issues, frustrations, or anything to say, contact me. I will work hard to make it even more awesome.
